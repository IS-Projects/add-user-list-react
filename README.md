# add-user-list-react

This repository is created to put in practice the first modules of the course "React - The Complete Guide 2022" by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. The main branch showcases my solution to the practice, and the tutorial-way branch includes, as its name mentions it, the way it was solved in the tutorial (React course).

## Script to run the project:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.
